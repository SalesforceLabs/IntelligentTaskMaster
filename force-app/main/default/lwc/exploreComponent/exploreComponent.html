                    <lightning-layout-item size="12" padding="around-small">
                        <p class="pstyle">Mentoring is the way forward in any field for anyone seeking growth or looking to coach and grow others. Itâ€™s a very important human tool that helps people to learn by example and be coached by role models.</p>
                        <p class="pstyle">Going through trailheads and well-written documentation is all good but having a place to search for mentors, be seen as a mentee & track all the interactions in a mentorship automatically in an app provides an invaluable intuitive user experience. Hence this app was created.</p>
